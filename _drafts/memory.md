RAM is referred to as volatile memory and is lost when the power is turned off whereas ROM in non volatile and the contents are retained even after the power is switched off. RAM is called volatile because it is temporary memory. ROM is called non volatile because it is permanent memory.


Examples of non-volatile memory include read-only memory, flash memory, ferroelectric RAM, most types of magnetic computer storage devices (e.g. hard disk drives, solid state drives, floppy disks, and magnetic tape), optical discs, and early computer storage methods such as paper tape and punched cards.[1]

Non-volatile memory can be classified as traditional non-volatile disk storage, or storage in non-volatile memory chips (Flash memory Storage) – EEPROM, SSD, NAND, etc.
