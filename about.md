My name is Liu Jiao, i like being called Bill, I named myself this English name when i was in my 7th grade,it was the time i begin to learn English, i remember the meaning of the name,"brave fighter".

I am the only child of my parents, fron the time i started to remember things, my family was poor, we lived with my grandmother and one of my uncles.My mother is the best in the world, when i was 5 or younger, mother worked as a casual road cleaner, it was a very heavy work, she would get up on 4 O'clock in the morning, no matter how the weather is, no matter what the season is, 365 days in a year... The years left their mark on my mother，Time is so cruel. I feel so sad.

In 2016, i married my beautiful and understanding wife, in the past 3 years, you did so much to this family, thank you!

I met a lot of people after i gratuated from college, people who help me, peeople who plot against; i has done a variety of jobs，right job, wrong job; but doesn't matter anyway, life goes on. What is important is to follow an honest heart no matter what i am doing.

Stay hungry stay foolish. Hope i can work hard and never give up no matter what heppens!
